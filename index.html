            <h1>Hello.</h1>
            <h2>My name is Kévin Potier.</h2>
            <p>I’m a <b>software developer</b> with a background in theoretical physical chemistry. I have experience in <b>both front-end and back-end development</b> using modern technologies. I was doing a <b>PhD in theoretical physical chemistry</b>, where I simulated the adsorption and transport of various gases in porous carbons, mainly kerogen, for applications in energy. I’m <b>currently working at Groupagora on a mission at Orange</b>, where I’m redesigning the high-speed SMS sending component using micro services and cloud technology. I enjoy coding as a hobby as well as a profession, and I’m <b>always eager to learn new skills and explore new opportunities</b> in the world of software development. If you have any interesting projects or challenges in this area, I’d love to hear from you!</p>

                As a passionate <b>fan</b> of the <b>Habbo</b> virtual world, I <b>created a fansite</b> for a popular Habbo university that has attracted a thriving community of <b>over 500 users</b>. One of the key features of the site is the ability to manage both the "employees" and "students" of the university. Users can easily access important information such as news and schedules, making it a valuable resource for those involved with the university.

                I'm excited to share that I created a fansite for <b>Blablaland</b>, a popular online game. The site offers a variety of features, including the ability to <b>play mini-games, create clans, and read the latest news about Blablaland</b>. It's been a rewarding experience to see more than <b>100 users</b> engage with the site and connect with one another over their shared love for the game.
