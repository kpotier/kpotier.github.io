            <h1>Hello.</h1>
            <h2>My name is KÃ©vin Potier.</h2>
            <p>I'm a <b>scientist</b> specializing in theoretical physical chemistry, with a <b>passion for coding</b>. I spend a significant portion of my day writing code for my thesis, but I also enjoy coding as a hobby. In fact, I'm a full-stack developer with experience in <b>both front-end and back-end development</b>. While my main focus is in theoretical physical chemistry, I'm always excited to <b>explore new opportunities</b> in the world of software development. So, if you have any interesting opportunities in this area, I'd be delighted to connect with you!</p>

                As a passionate <b>fan</b> of the <b>Habbo</b> virtual world, I <b>created a fansite</b> for a popular Habbo university that has attracted a thriving community of <b>over 500 users</b>. One of the key features of the site is the ability to manage both the "employees" and "students" of the university. Users can easily access important information such as news and schedules, making it a valuable resource for those involved with the university.

                I'm excited to share that I created a fansite for <b>Blablaland</b>, a popular online game. The site offers a variety of features, including the ability to <b>play mini-games, create clans, and read the latest news about Blablaland</b>. It's been a rewarding experience to see users engage with the site and connect with one another over their shared love for the game.
